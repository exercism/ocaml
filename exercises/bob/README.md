# Bob

Bob is a lackadaisical teenager. In conversation, his responses are very limited.

Bob answers 'Sure.' if you ask him a question.

He answers 'Whoa, chill out!' if you yell at him.

He answers 'Calm down, I know what I'm doing!' if you yell a question at him.

He says 'Fine. Be that way!' if you address him without actually saying
anything.

He answers 'Whatever.' to anything else.

## Error: No implementations provided for the following modules:
         Str referenced from bob.cmx

### Message
```
+ ocamlfind ocamlopt -linkpkg -g -thread -package oUnit -package core bob.cmx test.cmx -o test.native
File "_none_", line 1:
Error: No implementations provided for the following modules:
         Str referenced from bob.cmx
Command exited with code 2.
```

### Reason
You are using a module in your solution, in this case the `Str` module, and the
OCaml build tool is not aware of this.

### Solution
Add the module you are trying to use to the `ocamlbuild` build options.

Modify the `test.native` directive of the Makefile to be:

```
test.native: *.ml *.mli
    @corebuild -quiet -pkg oUnit -pkg str test.native
```

Note the additional `-pkg str` option.


## Getting Started
For installation and learning resources, refer to the
[exercism help page](http://exercism.io/languages/ocaml).

## Installation
To work on the exercises, you will need `Opam` and `Core`. Consult [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org) website for instructions on how to install `opam` for your OS. Once `opam` is installed open a terminal window and run the following command to install core:

```bash
opam install core
```

To run the tests you will need `OUnit`. Install it using `opam`:

```bash
opam install ounit
```

## Running Tests
A Makefile is provided with a default target to compile your solution and run the tests. At the command line, type:

```bash
make
```

## Interactive Shell
`utop` is a command line program which allows you to run Ocaml code interactively. The easiest way to install it is via opam:
```bash
opam install utop
```
Consult [utop](https://github.com/diml/utop/blob/master/README.md) for more detail.

## Feedback, Issues, Pull Requests
The [exercism/ocaml](https://github.com/exercism/ocaml) repository on
GitHub is the home for all of the Ocaml exercises.

If you have feedback about an exercise, or want to help implementing a new
one, head over there and create an issue.  We'll do our best to help you!
