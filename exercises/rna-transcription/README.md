# RNA Transcription

Given a DNA strand, return its RNA complement (per RNA transcription).

Both DNA and RNA strands are a sequence of nucleotides.

The four nucleotides found in DNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**),
guanine (**G**) and thymine (**T**).

The four nucleotides found in RNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**),
guanine (**G**) and uracil (**U**).

Given a DNA strand, its transcribed RNA strand is formed by replacing
each nucleotide with its complement:

* `G` -> `C`
* `C` -> `G`
* `T` -> `A`
* `A` -> `U`


## Getting Started
1. [Install the Exercism CLI](https://exercism.io/cli-walkthrough).

2. [Install OCaml](https://exercism.io/tracks/ocaml/installation).

3. For library documentation, follow [Useful OCaml resources](https://exercism.io/tracks/ocaml/resources).

## Running Tests
A `Makefile` is provided with a default target to compile your solution and run the tests. At the command line, type:

```bash
make
```

## Submitting Incomplete Solutions
It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have completed the exercise.

## Feedback, Issues, Pull Requests
The [exercism/ocaml](https://github.com/exercism/ocaml) repository on GitHub is
the home for all of the Ocaml exercises.

If you have feedback about an exercise, or want to help implementing a new
one, head over there and create an issue or submit a PR. We welcome new
contributors!
